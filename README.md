ofxBezierWarp
=============

ofxBezier is capable of quickly warping anything one can distort/undistort using Open Graphics Library (OpenGL) Bezier surfaces. Its syntax is similar to that of a Frame Buffer Object (FBO) and incorporates an allocate, begin, end and draw style interface.

The code was adapted and modified from the method described here: http://forum.openframeworks.cc/index.php/topic,4002.0.html
